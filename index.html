      <h1>The Relationship Between GHIAA Membership, Presence, and Town Demographics</h1>

          <p class="lead">
          The questions that I chose to address were thus: 1) In each town, what is the ratio of GHIAA member congregations to all congregations? and 2) How do demographics (such as median household income, etc.) vary between towns with higher versus lower ratios of GHIAA members to non-members?

Approaching these questions, I was honestly unsure what the data would show. While this made me uneasy, it also excited me - the chance to approach a complex question with absolutely zero expectations or biases is rare. 

Utilizing raw data provided by our community partners, I decided to filter and whittle down the data to be able to find the ratio of GHIAA members to all congregations. After finding the ratios, I utilized a pivot table to compile the number of GHIAA members and all congregations in each town. I uploaded the data into the Datawrapper tool, creating a choropleth map that helps us visualize GHIAA presence in each town. 

          </p>

          <iframe title="Percentage of GHIAA Members Among All Congregations in Each Town, Greater Hartford" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-OIUj5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OIUj5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="742"></iframe>

          <p class="lead">
          From the choropleth map above, there seems to be a cluster of GHIAA presence in and around Hartford, with GHIAA presence diluting as we move further away from Hartford proper.

Now that we can visualize the presence of GHIAA congregations in different towns in the region, we can move on to answering Question 2. I pulled demographic information, specifically median household income, for each town from the American Community Survey. Afterwards, I utilized Google Sheets to create a scatter plot so we could observe the relationship between the two variables: median household income and GHIAA/Total Congregation ratio.
